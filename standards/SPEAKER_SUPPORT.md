- Explain the importance of moderation, what to do if there are bad actors in the audience.

See also Code of Conduct.

### Importance of time keeping

If the talk or the Q & A afterwards overruns, this can have problems for other speakers (perhaps they can only be at your event for a limited time because of transportation issues. So it's important to have a time keeper.
