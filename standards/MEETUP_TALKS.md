# How to organise a talk based meet up

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide a checklist and timeline for organising talk based meetups. This is based around the process used by the [London Rust User Group][link_lrug].

The expected audience for this document are people who are new to setting up meetups or organising this type of format.

Where relevant I will cite actual examples using the names of services or organisations (Skillsmatter, meetup.com, etc) that we currently use at the London user group.

## Timeline

- 4 weeks to go
  - Confirm speakers and get the following from each of them:
    - Speaker's bio
    - Title of talk
    - Synopsis of talk
    - Duration of talk - Generally talks fall under the following category based on their duration:
      - 5-15m lightning
      - 25m-45m regular talks + 5-10m Q&A
      - &gt; 60m long talks - it's worth advising the speaker to avoid talks of this duration unless some form of continual Q&A or audience participation takes place.
  - Share this with venue if relevant. Our hosts Skillsmatter have their own website and newsletter which provides free advertisement to their event. It's often helpful to gain a similar relationship in your meetup as the host will often have a bigger audience reach.
  - Add to meetup/group event page, enable RSVP if you have the capability.
- 3 weeks
  - Send out reminders via meetup, twitter or other social media.
- 2 weeks
  - Add lightning speakers
  - Send out reminders via meetup, twitter or other social media.
- 1 week to go
  - Send a follow up email with speakers:
    - Send details of location to venue, suggested route from nearest bus/train station.
  - Send out reminders via meetup, twitter or other social media
- On the day
  - Decide running order of speakers

## Time keeping

If you have more than one speaker, time keeping is essential. Failing to do so could potential mean other speakers lose their opportunity to speak because your venue has limited hours allows meetups between the hours of 6pm-10pm.

Ensure that all speakers are aware of this limitation. 

The recommended approach advise the speaker of time left, is to have warnings at 5min intervals starting at 15mins remaining of talk duration. Tip: you can tell the speaker through the use of cards with the time remaining or verbally. The latter is useful to remember since you won't have a mic so the video recording if you have one will not pick up the prompts.

Also don't forget to time keep the Q&A section!

## Hints and tips

- **Booking venue**: it's often easier to pre-book in quarters i.e. January to March, April to June, etc.
- **Beg, steal, borrow**: if you attend other techical meetups, try booking their venue.
- **Speakers**: if you're struggling to find local speakers, why not try a remote talk. These are trickier to setup, but can sometimes give you the access to speakers who wouldn't ordinarily be available because of your location.
- **#rustlang**: The Rust [@rustlang][link_rust_twitter] twitter account will usually retweet any tweets with the #rustlang has tag, so use this to advertise your meetup.
- **URLO**: Also posting to our favourite Rust forum [users.rust-lang.org][link_urlo] is a great way to advertise too! Use the announcement category to gain maximum reach.
